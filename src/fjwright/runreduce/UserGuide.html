    <h2 id="GeneralInformation">General Information</h2>

    <p>Run-REDUCE-FX remembers user preferences and uses them the next
    time it starts. It uses the standard Java
    package <em>java.util.prefs</em>, which stores data persistently
    in an implementation-dependent backing store. On Microsoft Windows
    the preferences for this application are stored in the registry
    under the key
    "<code>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\fjwright\runreduce</code>"
    and on Linux they are stored in the XML file
    "<code>~/.java/.userPrefs/fjwright/runreduce/prefs.xml</code>".
    </p>
    <p>By default, Run-REDUCE-FX looks in the standard places for a
    REDUCE installation. On Microsoft Windows it looks for the folder
    "<code>\Program Files\Reduce</code>" on all accessible drives. On
    Linux it assumes that executable files are under
    "<code>/usr/lib/reduce</code>", package information is in
    "<code>/usr/share/reduce/packages</code>", and documentation is in
    "<code>/usr/share/doc/reduce</code>". But this information can all
    be <a href="#Configure">reconfigured</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="MainWindow">The Main Window</h2>

    <p>The main window consists of one or more REDUCE panels that can
    each run an independent invocation of REDUCE.  There are three
    options: a single REDUCE panel (the default); a split pane
    containing two REDUCE panels side-by-side that are both visible; a
    tabbed pane containing one or more REDUCE panels, of which only
    the selected panel is visible.  The choice of display pane
    arrangement is controlled by options in
    the <a href="#ViewMenu">View menu</a>.  You can switch dynamically
    among the three options, in which case the currently selected
    REDUCE panel (only) and the REDUCE invocation running in it (if
    any) is preserved and carried to the new display pane arrangement,
    but any other REDUCE invocations are discarded.  With a split or
    tabbed pane, the active REDUCE panel can be selected by clicking
    on the desired panel in a split pane or tab on a tabbed pane.  The
    non-selected panel in a split pane is greyed out and the selected
    panel displays a green dot near the top right-hand corner,
    immediately to the left of the <em>Hide Editor</em> toggle button.
    All controls apply (primarily) to the currently selected REDUCE
    panel.
    </p>
    <p>Tabs are initially labelled <em>Tab 1</em>, <em>Tab 2</em>,
    etc., and a new tab is labelled <em>Tab n</em> if it is
    the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> tab to be added.  (Removing tabs does
    not affect the numbering.) However, when REDUCE is run in a tab,
    the tab label changes to the name of the REDUCE command being run,
    and remains so until a different REDUCE command is run in that
    tab.
    </p>
    <h3>REDUCE Panels</h3>
    <p>A REDUCE panel normally consists of two panes one above the
    other.  The top pane displays all the REDUCE input and output in
    the current session.  It is read-only.  The bottom pane is an
    input editor that supports all the standard keyboard and
    mouse-based editing facilities normally provided by your platform.
    It is disabled unless REDUCE is running in this panel.  Both panes
    display vertical and horizontal scroll bars when necessary.  Text
    does not wrap.  The horizontal divider separating the two panes
    can be dragged up and down.
    </p>
    <p>There is a toggle button in the top right-hand corner of each
    REDUCE panel, which when clicked hides the input editor.  This is
    useful for viewing long runs of output.  Clicking the button again
    shows the input editor.
    </p>
    <p>The name of the currently running (or last run) REDUCE command
    is appended to the label of the REDUCE input/output display pane.
    (You can edit the command names in the <a href="#Configure">REDUCE
    configuration dialogue</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>You type (or paste) REDUCE input into the input editor pane,
    edit it as necessary, and then click on the <em>Send Input</em>
    button, which sends the input to REDUCE and echos it in the top
    pane.  This clears the input editor, but you can scroll through
    the previous input (entered via the input editor) using
    the <em>Earlier Input</em> and <em>Later Input</em> buttons.
    Scrolling to input later than the last previous input clears the
    input editor pane back to its state before you started scrolling.
    </p>
    <p>When keyboard focus is in the input editor pane, the following
    keyboard shortcuts are active:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Keyboard Shortcut</th>
                <th>Action</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Control+Enter</em></td>
                <td>Send Input (auto-terminated)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Control+Shift+Enter</em></td>
                <td>Send Input (not auto-terminated)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Control+UpArrow</em></td>
                <td>Earlier Input</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Control+DownArrow</em></td>
                <td>Later Input</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>where <em>Enter</em> is the <em>Return</em> or <em>Enter</em>
    key and <em>UpArrow</em> / <em>DownArrow</em> are the cursor up /
    down keys, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>Sending input to REDUCE strips any trailing white space,
    normally auto-terminates it by adding a semicolon if there was no
    final terminator, and then adds a final newline. However, if
    Run-REDUCE-FX detects a question mark in the input prompt then it
    suppresses auto-termination (so if you really want a terminator
    you must enter it explicitly). As an additional precaution,
    holding the <em>Shift</em> key while clicking on the <em>Send
    Input</em> button or pressing <em>Control+Enter</em> always
    suppresses auto-termination.
    </p>
    <p>You can edit previous input recalled into the input editor as
    necessary and then send it to REDUCE. Input can be multi-line, in
    which case Run-REDUCE-FX processes all the lines
    together. The <em>Send Input</em> action is disabled unless
    REDUCE is running, and the <em>Earlier Input</em>
    and <em>Later Input</em> actions are disabled unless there is
    earlier or later input, respectively.
    </p>

    <h2 id="PopupKeyboard">The Pop-up Keyboard</h2>

    <p>The pop-up keyboard provides access to special symbols and
    Greek letters on the top half of the keyboard and elementary
    functions on the bottom half.  It is available by clicking the
    primary mouse-button (normally the left if there is more than one)
    while holding down the <em>Control</em> key or clicking the middle
    mouse-button on an input editor text area or any text field in
    a <a href="#TemplatesMenu">template</a>
    or <a href="#FunctionsMenu">function</a> dialogue.  Clicking on a
    character button on the top half of the pop-up keyboard causes
    that character to overwrite the selected text if there is any or
    otherwise to insert at the text cursor (caret).  Clicking on a
    function button on the bottom half of the pop-up keyboard causes
    that function to be applied to the selected text if there is any
    (i.e. wrapped around it using parentheses) or otherwise to be
    inserted (without parentheses) at the text cursor.  The pop-up
    then closes.  The pop-up also closes if you click anywhere outside
    it, or you can close it by clicking on the <em>Close</em> button
    in the bottom left corner or by pressing the <em>Escape</em> key
    on your main keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>If you don't have a middle mouse-button but you have a wheel
    mouse then pressing on the wheel may generate a middle
    mouse-button click.  If you use an older touch pad with separate
    buttons then clicking the left and right touch-pad buttons
    together may generate a middle mouse-button click.  If you use a
    newer touch pad with no separate buttons then pressing (not just
    tapping) with three fingers may generate a middle mouse-button
    click.  You may need to adjust your mouse or touch-pad
    configuration to be able to generate a middle mouse-button click.
    Note that clicking the secondary (normally the right) mouse-button
    on any text field pops up a generic editor context menu.
    </p>
    <p>By default, the top half of the pop-up keyboard provides the
    REDUCE symbolic constants &infin; (infinity) and &pi; (pi) in the
    left column and the lower-case Greek alphabet in the right block,
    and the bottom half of the pop-up keyboard provides common
    elementary functions in the left block and trigonometric and
    hyperbolic functions in the right block.  The pop-up keyboard has
    two layers and the secondary layer is accessed by either clicking
    on the <em>Shift</em> button in the top left corner or holding
    down the <em>Shift</em> key on your main keyboard.  Note that the
    physical <em>Shift</em> key does not act as a toggle but the
    virtual <em>Shift</em> button does.  The top half of the secondary
    keyboard layer provides additional REDUCE symbolic constants and
    upper-case Greek letters; the bottom half provides common
    predicates and inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.
    </p>
    <p>The symbolic constants in the top left column and the Greek
    alphabet in the top right block look similar but are treated
    slightly differently.  REDUCE only recognises symbolic constants
    if their names are spelt out appropriately using ASCII characters,
    so this is done automatically before sending them to REDUCE.
    Currently, by default, the Greek letters in the top right block
    are all sent to REDUCE with no processing, which is probably not
    very useful, but see below for the use of the <em>English</em>
    button!  CSL REDUCE treats them as letters with no predefined
    meaning and outputs them as they are input, without case-folding,
    but typeset maths output displays them as upper case.  PSL REDUCE
    treats them as errors, so don't use them with PSL REDUCE.  Beware
    that many upper-case Greek letters look like upper-case Roman
    letters but are in fact distinct!
    </p>
    <p>If you hover your mouse pointer over a symbolic constant button
    then a tooltip pops up giving the REDUCE name of the constant and
    a brief description of it and/or its conventional name and
    approximate numerical value (if appropriate).  If you hover your
    mouse pointer over a Greek letter button then a tooltip pops up
    giving its name spelt out in English, using the same
    capitalisation convention as TeX.  (But note that the Greek
    letters that look like Roman letters are not available as distinct
    characters in TeX.)  If you click on the <em>English</em> button
    in the top right corner of the pop-up keyboard or hold down
    the <em>Alt</em> key whilst clicking on any button on the top half
    of the pop-up keyboard then its name spelt-out using ASCII
    characters is output instead of the single non-ASCII character.
    The result is accepted as an identifier and typeset as the
    appropriate Greek letter by all versions of REDUCE.  It is also
    useful, for example when using the REDUCE LaTeX formula interface
    provided by the RLFI package.  For symbolic constants the REDUCE
    names are output directly.
    </p>
    <p>If you hover your mouse pointer over a function key then a
    tooltip pops up giving its full name.  If you click on
    the <em>Radians</em> button in the bottom right corner of the
    pop-up keyboard or hold down the <em>Alt</em> key whilst clicking
    on any trigonometric function button then the degree version of
    the function is used.  The label on the <em>Radians</em> button
    changes to <em>Degrees</em> it you click on it or hold down
    the <em>Alt</em> key, and changes back to <em>Radians</em> if you
    click on it again or release the <em>Alt</em> key.  This label
    shows the <strong>current</strong> trigonometric function mode.
    Note that degree mode only works if the TRIGD package has been
    loaded in REDUCE.  At some later date I hope to be able to
    automate this, but for now you need to do it by hand.
    </p>
    <p>Note that some characters are available as both symbolic
    constants and as Greek letters.  For example, &pi; as a symbolic
    constant is always spelt out appropriately using ASCII characters
    before sending it to REDUCE whereas &pi; as a Greek letter is not,
    so that within REDUCE the two are completely unrelated and in CSL
    REDUCE &pi; as a Greek letter can be used freely as an identifier
    (or part of one).  In order to preserve the two meanings, the
    symbolic constants are preceded by a Unicode zero-width non-joiner
    (ZWNJ) character, which is removed automatically when the symbolic
    constant is sent to REDUCE.  The ZWNJ character is invisible but
    it is nevertheless there.  If you move the text cursor past a
    symbolic constant you will also need to move it past the ZWNJ
    character, although you will not see the cursor move, and if you
    delete a symbolic constant you should also delete the ZWNJ
    character, although again you will not see the cursor move.  (If
    you don't delete it then it could cause confusion.)
    </p>

    <h2 id="FileMenu">The File Menu</h2>

    <p>Some items in this menu pop up a dialogue that allows you to
    select one or more items, such as filenames. This dialogue
    supports all the standard keyboard and mouse-based selection
    facilities normally provided by your platform. In particular, in
    dialogues that allow selection of multiple items, holding
    the <em>Control</em> key down while clicking on an item selects or
    deselects it without affecting any other selections, and holding
    a <em>Shift</em> key down while clicking on an item extends the
    selection to that item. Double-clicking on an item selects it and
    then immediately runs the action associated with the confirmation
    button.
    </p>
    <p>Most of the menu items run a REDUCE command, which is echoed in
    the display pane but does not appear in the input editor. The file
    chooser dialogues all share the same default directory, which
    normally is initially your home directory, but the last directory
    you used will be the default directory the next time you use a
    file chooser dialogue. This default directory is independent of
    REDUCE's default directory, which is irrelevant because
    Run-REDUCE-FX always uses absolute file paths.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>File</em> menu provides the following items:</p>
    <h3>Echo File Input</h3>
    <p>Selecting this causes Run-REDUCE-FX to echo file input to
    the <em>Input/Output Display</em> pane. It is selectd by
    default.</p>
    <h3>Input from Files...</h3>
    <p>This displays a file chooser that allows you to choose one or
    more source code files to input into REDUCE (using the
    REDUCE <code>IN</code> command).  By default, the file chooser
    shows only <code>*.red</code> and <code>*.tst</code> files, but
    you can reset it to show only <code>*.txt</code> files or all
    files. (Note that the recommended extension for REDUCE source code
    file names is <code>.red</code> and that a REDUCE source code file
    should end with <code>;end;</code> to avoid an error message.)
    This menu item is disabled unless REDUCE is running.
    </p>
    <h3>Input Package Files...</h3>
    <p>This works the same as the previous menu item except that the
    initial directory is always the REDUCE packages directory. It is
    primarily intended to provide easy access to the package test
    files.
    </p>
    <h3>Output to New File...</h3>
    <p>This displays a file chooser that allows you to choose a file
    to send output to instead of the GUI (using the
    REDUCE <code>OUT</code> command). By default, the file chooser
    shows only <code>*.log and *.rlg</code> files, but you can reset
    it to show only <code>*.txt</code> files or all files. (Note that
    the extension used for REDUCE package test output log file names
    is <code>.rlg</code>.) Only one output file can be active at a
    time and choosing a new output file redirects output to that file
    without shutting the previous output file. The GUI remember all
    the open output files (opened via this menu item) to facilitate
    switching or shutting output files as described below. This menu
    item is disabled unless REDUCE is running.
    </p>
    <h3>Output to Open File...</h3>
    <p>This displays a list of open output files and allows you to
    select one for output. This menu item is disabled unless there are
    open output files.</p>
    <h3>Output Here</h3>
    <p>This redirects output to the GUI without shutting the current
    output file (using the REDUCE <code>OUT T</code> command). This
    menu item is disabled unless there are open output files.
    </p>
    <h3>Shut Output Files...</h3>
    <p>This displays a list of open output files and allows you to
    select one or more to be shut (using the REDUCE <code>SHUT</code>
    command). This menu item is disabled unless there are open output
    files.</p>
    <h3>Shut Last Output File</h3>
    <p>This shuts the last used open output file (using the
    REDUCE <code>SHUT</code> command). This menu item is disabled
    unless there are open output files.
    </p>
    <h3>Print Session Log...</h3>
    <p>This prints the whole content of the <em>Input/Output
    Display</em> pane including all styling, after first displaying
    your platform's standard print dialogue.  After you confirm the
    print dialogue, an alert pops up to either confirm that the
    session log has been sent to the printer or report failure.
    </p>
    <h3>Save Session Log...</h3>
    <p>This displays a file chooser that allows you to specify a file
    to which to save the entire contents of the <em>Input/Output
    Display</em> pane.  By default, the file chooser shows
    only <code>*.log</code> and <code>*.rlg</code> files, but you can
    reset it to show only <code>*.txt</code> files or all files.  The
    filename defaults to <code>session.log</code>, but you can change
    this.  If the specified file already exists then the session log
    overwrites its previous content.  Typeset maths is output as the
    TeX markup generated by the REDUCE <em>fmprint</em> package.
    </p>
    <h3>Append Session Log...</h3>
    <p>This works the same as the previous menu item except that if
    the specified file exists then the session log is appended to its
    previous content.</p>
    <h3>Exit</h3>
    <p>This terminates both REDUCE and the Run-REDUCE-FX GUI, as does
    the close widget that is normally at the top right-hand corner of
    the main window frame.
    </p>

    <h2 id="REDUCEMenu">The REDUCE Menu</h2>

    <p>The <em>REDUCE</em> menu provides the following items:</p>
    <h3>Run REDUCE...</h3>
    <p>This sub-menu provides an item for each configured REDUCE
    command (typically based on different versions of Lisp, by default
    CSL and PSL). Clicking on a REDUCE command runs it. This sub-menu
    is disabled when REDUCE is running.
    </p>
    <h3>Auto-run REDUCE...</h3>
    <p>This sub-menu allows you to select a REDUCE command that
    Run-REDUCE-FX will run automatically when it starts, or
    none. Run-REDUCE-FX remembers this selection and uses it the next
    time it starts. If REDUCE is not running then Run-REDUCE-FX also
    runs the selected REDUCE command immediately.
    </p>
    <h3>Load Packages...</h3>
    <p>This displays a list of standard REDUCE packages and allows you
    to select one or more to load (using the
    REDUCE <code>LOAD_PACKAGE</code> command).  The list excludes
    packages that are pre-loaded and is sorted alphabetically.
    Run-REDUCE-FX determines the list of packages each time it starts
    up by reading the <code>package.map</code> file in the REDUCE
    installation.  This menu item is disabled unless REDUCE is
    running.
    </p>
    <h3>Stop REDUCE</h3>
    <p>This terminates REDUCE but <strong>not</strong> the
    Run-REDUCE-FX GUI. <strong>It is the recommended way to stop
    REDUCE because then Run-REDUCE-FX reliably knows that REDUCE is no
    longer running.</strong> (Run-REDUCE-FX tries to detect input of
    the <code>BYE</code> and <code>QUIT</code> commands via the input
    editor, but this may be less reliable.) This menu item is disabled
    unless REDUCE is running.
    </p>
    <h3>Clear I/O Display</h3>
    <p>This completely erases the content of the <em>Input/Output
    Display</em> pane. If you want to keep the content, use
    the <em>Save / Append Session Log...</em> item on
    the <em>File</em> menu before clearing!
    </p>
    <h3 id="Configure">Configure REDUCE...</h3>
    <p>This displays a dialogue that allows you to configure the
    REDUCE directories and commands.  The defaults should work for
    standard installations on Microsoft Windows and Linux.
    Run-REDUCE-FX currently assumes that if it is not running on
    Windows then the Linux default configuration is appropriate, so
    that is what you will see by default on (say) Apple MacOS.  There
    is a button to reset the whole REDUCE configuration to the
    platform defaults.
    </p>
    <p>Changes made using this dialogue are saved when you click on
    the <em>Save</em> button, in which case the new configuration is
    used within Run-REDUCE-FX and saved as preferences.  Clicking on
    the <em>Cancel</em> button causes all changes made since the
    dialogue opened to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>Note that all field values are stripped of leading and trailing
    space before they are used or saved, and empty fields are not
    saved at all.  Where appropriate, text fields have a button beside
    them labelled "...".  This button displays a directory or file
    chooser that can be used to set the field (which can then be
    edited further).  The initial directory used by the directory or
    file chooser is the platform default.
    </p>
    <p>Clicking on the <em>Delete Selected Command</em> button deletes
    the configuration for the selected REDUCE command.  If you delete
    all available commands then a new (empty) command is automatically
    created.
    </p>
    <p>Clicking on the <em>Duplicate Selected Command</em> button
    duplicates the configuration for the selected REDUCE command
    immediately below it in the list.  The label of the duplicate
    command is the label of the duplicated command with <em>New</em>
    appended, which you can edit as you wish.  (But keep command
    labels fairly short!).  Changes to the <em>Command Label</em>
    field are reflected in the list of REDUCE commands only when you
    press Enter (or click on the <em>Save</em> button).  This provides
    a convenient way, for example, to add one or more REDUCE commands
    with non-standard options such as memory size.
    </p>
    <p>Clicking on the <em>Add New Command</em> button adds a new
    REDUCE command, which is initially labelled <em>New Command</em>,
    with all other fields empty.  You could, for example, add one or
    more commands running REDUCE on Common Lisp.  (At some future date
    I may include CL REDUCE in the default configuration.)
    </p>
    <p>A complete REDUCE command must be split into the pathname of an
      executable <strong>binary</strong> command and a sequence of up
      to 5 command arguments. (It would be easy to increase this
      limit, but I hope 5 arguments is enough!)  The components of the
      command that would be separated by white space in a shell
      command must be entered into separate fields on this form.
      (Blank arguments are ignored.)  Note that Run-REDUCE-FX does not
      currently use a shell to run REDUCE and the command specified is
      used directly to create a separate process to run REDUCE.  So do
      not include any shell escapes or other shell syntax!  (Think of
      Run-REDUCE-FX as replacing the shell script normally used to run
      REDUCE.)
    </p>
    <p>You can use absolute pathnames if you want, but often (as with
      the PSL REDUCE executable and image file names) command
      components share a common root segment.  This root segment can
      be specified as <code>$REDUCE</code>, which Run-REDUCE-FX will
      replace with the value of the <em>Command Root Directory</em>
      field if it is set, or with the value of the <em>REDUCE Root
      Directory</em> field otherwise.  (I have borrowed environment
      variable syntax, but <code>$REDUCE</code> here is not related to
      any environment variable.)
    </p>
    <p>The two default REDUCE commands, which assume standard
    installations of CSL and PSL REDUCE, share the same root
    directory, which is why the default configuration uses <em>REDUCE
    Root Directory</em> and leaves <em>Command Root Directory</em>
    empty. But a version of REDUCE running on Common Lisp would
    probably use a different root directory.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Load Packages...</em> facility in the <em>File</em>
    menu requires a standard REDUCE packages directory, which should
    be specified as the value of the <em>REDUCE Packages
    Directory</em> field.  This directory should contain directories
    named <em>alg</em>, <em>algint</em>, <em>arith</em>, etc.  This
    field is only used by <em>Load Packages...</em>.  If this
    directory does not exist or is mis-configured then <em>Load
    Packages...</em> will pop up a warning and closing it will
    automatically pop up the <em>Configure REDUCE...</em> dialogue to
    allow you to correct the problem.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>Help</em> menu items that display REDUCE documentation
    require directories containing the distributed documentation files
    to be specified as the values of the <em>REDUCE Manual
    Directory</em> and <em>REDUCE Primers Directory</em> fields.
    These fields are named after the directories in the REDUCE
    repository and the same split is used by the standard Windows
    installation folders although on a standard Linux installation the
    two directories are the same.  The <em>REDUCE Manual
    Directory</em> should contain the files <em>manual.html</em>
    and <em>manual.pdf</em> and the <em>REDUCE Primers Directory</em>
    should contain the
    files <em>insidereduce.pdf</em>, <em>primer.pdf</em>
    and <em>sl.pdf</em>, where on Linux the filename extension
    is <em>.pdf.gz</em> instead of just <em>.pdf</em>.
    </p>
    <p>The <em>REDUCE Working Directory</em> field allows you to
      configure the initial working directory used by REDUCE and the
      initial directory used by all the file choosers available from
      the <em>File</em> menu.  (However, note that this is only the
      initial directory because you can change the directory when you
      use a file chooser and the file choosers remember and share the
      last directory used.  But this does not change REDUCE's working
      directory!)  By default, the <em>REDUCE Working Directory</em>
      is your home directory, but you can change it to anything you
      want.  The button beside this field labelled "..." does not pop
      up a directory chooser directly, but instead pops up a context
      menu with items labelled <em>Your Home
      Directory</em>, <em>Run-REDUCE-FX Directory</em> and <em>Choose
      Any Directory</em>, which respectively set the <em>REDUCE
      Working Directory</em> field to your home directory, the
      directory containing <em>Run-REDUCE-FX.jar</em>, or any
      directory you choose using the directory chooser that pops up.
    </p>
    <p>The directories described above relate to the portable REDUCE
    source code and are independent of particular REDUCE
    implementations, so they are fixed for all REDUCE commands.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ViewMenu">The View Menu</h2>

    <p>Run-REDUCE-FX remembers the options you select using
    the <em>View</em> menu and uses them the next time you start
    Run-REDUCE-FX.  The first four options (above the separator) apply
    to each REDUCE panel independently and Run-REDUCE-FX uses the last
    set values initially when you create a new REDUCE panel.
    The <em>View</em> menu provides the following items:</p>
    <h3>Font Size...</h3>
    <p>This displays a dialogue that allows you to change the font
    size used in the <em>Input/Output Display</em> and <em>Input
    Editor</em> panes.
    </p>
    <h3>Bold Prompts</h3>
    <p>Selecting this item causes Run-REDUCE-FX to embolden the
    display of all input prompts.
    </p>
    <h3>I/O Colouring</h3>
    <p>This sub-menu allows you to select an I/O colouring
    option: <em>None</em>, <em>Modal</em>
    or <em>Redfront</em>.  <em>Modal</em> colouring depends on
    REDUCE's current input mode: algebraic-mode prompts and input are
    red, algebraic-mode output is blue, symbolic-mode prompts and
    input are brown, symbolic-mode output is
    purple.  <em>Redfront</em> colouring is intended to provide a full
    emulation of the standard REDUCE <em>redfront</em> facility and it
    loads the <em>redfront</em> package (silently), which outputs
    additional markup that is interpreted by Run-REDUCE-FX in the same
    way that it is normally interpreted by the <em>redfront</em>
    executable running in a suitable terminal (emulator).
    With <em>Redfront</em> colouring, all prompts and interactive
    input are red, algebraic-mode output is blue, and echoed file
    input and symbolic-mode output are not coloured.
    </p>
    <p>Note that turning I/O colouring on does not fully take effect
    until the next input prompt.  Turning I/O colouring off (by
    selecting <em>None</em>) takes effect immediately and turning it
    back on mid-session turns any previous I/O colouring back on, but
    any I/O produced while I/O colouring was turned off will not be
    coloured.  (This is because the required markup is only generated
    when I/O colouring is turned on to conserve resources.)
    </p>
    <h3>Typeset Maths</h3>
    <p>Selecting this item causes Run-REDUCE-FX to display
      algebraic-mode mathematical output more-or-less as it would be
      typeset and centred horizontally.  <strong>WARNINGS:</strong>
      Typeset Maths is currently experimental.  It interacts badly
      with redfront I/O colouring, so don't try to use the two
      together: one will effectively cancel the other.  Big delimiters
      are not handled correctly: they or their components are too
      small.  If any TeX markup appears (coloured red) in the output
      then please let me know!  <em>Save Session Log...</em> outputs
      typeset maths using TeX markup.
    </p>
    <h3>Single Pane Display</h3>
    <p>Selecting this causes Run-REDUCE-FX to display the selected
    REDUCE panel only. This is the default.
    </p>
    <h3>Split Pane Display</h3>
    <p>Selecting this causes Run-REDUCE-FX to display two REDUCE
    panels side-by-side. The left-hand panel displays the previously
    selected REDUCE panel (if any) and is initially active. Clicking
    on a REDUCE panel makes it active for input via its input editor
    pane and the menus. The inactive REDUCE panel can continue to
    update its output display. Both panels are the same size
    initially, but you can change that by dragging the divider.
    </p>
    <h3>Tabbed Pane Display</h3>
    <p>Selecting this causes Run-REDUCE-FX to display a tabbed pane
    with the previously selected REDUCE panel (if any) displayed under
    the first tab.  Clicking on the <code>&times;</code> icon at the
    right of the selected tab label removes that tab and the REDUCE
    panel it contains. When there is only one tab, removing it
    disables tabbed display but preserves the REDUCE panel that the
    tab contained.
    </p>
    <h3>Add Another Tab</h3>
    <p>This adds a new tab to a tabbed display.  This menu item is
    disabled unless tabbed pane display is selected.
    </p>

    <h2 id="TemplatesMenu">The Templates Menu</h2>

    <p>The <em>Templates</em> menu facilitates construction of
    structured expressions and statements whose syntax might not be
    immediately obvious, especially to a novice.  The template
    dialogues all provide hyperlinks to the key sections of the local
    HTML version of the REDUCE Manual, which open in your default web
    browser.  The dialogues all provide two buttons that apply the
    filled-in template: the <em>Edit</em> button inserts the template
    output into the input editor at the current cursor position;
    the <em>Evaluate</em> button sends the template output directly to
    REDUCE for evaluation, adding a terminator if necessary, just as
    the <em>Send Input</em> button does.  These buttons do not close
    the dialogue, which is non-modal (meaning it does not prevent
    access to other windows) and can be left open but moved out of the
    way.  In fact, several template dialogues can be open at the same
    time.  To close a template dialogue, click on the <em>Close</em>
    button.
    </p>
    <p>If the template represents an operator with a primary operand
    then this defaults to <em>ws</em>, which is convenient for simple
    interactive calculations, but it can be changed to anything.  The
    templates provide some minimal input validation: for example, if
    an element must be an explicit number (rather than a variable that
    must evaluate to a number), the template will check this and
    report an error immediately an inappropriate character is entered.
    When the <em>Evaluate</em> button is used, the template checks
    that all input has been provided that is required for valid REDUCE
    syntax; this is not done when the <em>Edit</em> button is used,
    assuming that further editing will take place.  This makes it easy
    to combine the output from templates, for example, to construct a
    multiple <em>for</em> loop.
    </p>
    <p>Some templates have a pair of radio buttons at the top
    labelled <em>Symbolic</em> and <em>Numeric</em> that allow you to
    switch between the two modes of evaluation; the default
    is <em>Symbolic</em>.  The <em>Numeric</em> option causes the
    template output to turn <em>rounded</em> mode on before the main
    template result is output and off again afterwards; it may also
    load the <em>numeric</em> package and use specific numerical
    versions of functions.  The text message towards the top of each
    template may vary depending on the <em>Symbolic/Numeric</em>
    option.
    </p>
    <p>Some templates have one or more switches towards the bottom,
    which may vary depending on the <em>Symbolic/Numeric</em> option.
    The switches consist of check boxes that initially show default
    settings (not those currently in effect in REDUCE).  Any switches
    that are changed from their defaults are set in the template
    output to reflect the change before the main template result is
    output and reset afterwards.  (Beware that this will override any
    changes from the default switch settings that were in effect
    before the template was used.)
    </p>
    <p>These templates are intended only for creating simple
    structures, but they can form the basis for arbitrarily complex
    structures if they are entered into the input editor for further
    editing.  The fields of expression templates display minimal
    formatting intended to hint at how such an expression would
    normally be typeset.
    </p>
    <p>This menu is disabled unless REDUCE is running.
    The <em>Templates</em> menu provides the following items:</p>
    <h3>Derivative...</h3>
    <p>This template supports (partial) differentiation involving up
    to three independent variables, each to arbitrary order.  The
    orders must be explicit positive integers and the total order
    automatically updates to reflect the number of independent
    variables and their orders.  If an order is omitted then it
    defaults to 1.  The first independent variable is required but
    others are optional.  The dependent variable defaults
    to <em>ws</em> and the first independent variable defaults
    to <em>x</em>, but both can be changed.
    </p>
    <h3>Integral...</h3>
    <p>This template supports both indefinite and definite
    integration: if both limits are omitted then the integral is
    indefinite; if both limits are specified then the integral is
    definite.  Note that only a definite integral can be evaluated
    numerically and the template checks this.  The integrand defaults
    to <em>ws</em> and the integration variable defaults
    to <em>x</em>, but both can be changed.</p>
    <p>By default, the template provides a single integral, but if you
    enter another integration variable in one of the boxes to the
    right of the primary integration variable then an additional
    integral appears wrapping the previous integral, thus supporting
    double and triple integrals.  Matching &int; and <em>d</em> symbol
    pairs have the same colour (blue, green or red) to facilitate
    adding limits to the right &int; symbol.
    </p>
    <h3>Limit...</h3>
    <p>This template supports limits of (mostly) continuous functions
    (as opposed to sequences).  By default, it computes a two-sided
    limit, which is appropriate if the function is continuous at the
    limit point.  By clicking successively on the superscript box to
    the right of the limit point field you cycle through the limit
    from the right/above, indicated by a superscript +, the limit from
    the left/below, indicated by a superscript -, and the default
    two-sided limit.  All fields are required.  The template includes
    an option to load the SPECFN package, which may improve some
    results (according to the SPECFN section of the REDUCE User's
    Manual).
    </p>
    <h3>Sum or Product...</h3>
    <p>This template supports finite repeated sums and products of
    sequences, i.e. functions of a discrete control variable that runs
    over a finite range of successive increasing integers.  You select
    whether to construct a sum or product by clicking on the
    appropriate toggle button, which defaults to a sum.  All fields
    are required.
    </p>
    <h3>Matrix...</h3>
    <p>This template supports the creation of matrices up to 4 by 4.
    The elements can be any expressions.  The (1,1) element is always
    in the top left-hand corner of the template.  The width of the
    matrix, i.e. the maximum column index, is determined by the
    right-most non-empty element and the depth of the matrix, i.e. the
    maximum row index, is determined by the lowest non-empty element.
    Within the matrix so determined, empty elements default to zero,
    which is very convenient for entering diagonal, triangular or
    other sparse matrices.
    </p>
    <h3>For Statement...</h3>
    <p>This template supports the creation of <em>for</em> statements
    and is modelled on the diagram at the start of the section of the
    REDUCE manual headed "FOR Statements".  You choose between
    iterating over a numerical range and a list by clicking on the
    appropriate tab, which then displays the appropriate template.
    You choose the <em>action</em> and the <em>for each ... in/on</em>
    option via pop-up choice boxes, which default to the most common
    choices.  (Note that the <em>for each ... on</em> option is only
    allowed in symbolic mode, but the template does not check this.)
    The field for the expression to be executed by the <em>for</em>
    statement is on a separate line to allow it more space.
    </p>

    <h2 id="FunctionsMenu">The Functions Menu</h2>

    <p>The <em>Functions</em> menu facilitates access to some of the
      mathematical functions provided by REDUCE via dialogue boxes
      similar to those provided by the <em>Templates</em> menu.  The
      functions provided include all the special functions listed in
      section 7.2 <em>Mathematical Functions</em> of the REDUCE User's
      Manual.  They also include some functions listed only in the
      section on the SPECFN package and when necessary the template
      output loads the SPECFN package.  The function dialogues all
      provide hyperlinks to the key sections of the local HTML version
      of the REDUCE Manual, which open in your default web browser.
    </p>
    <p>Hover over a function name to pop up a tooltip that gives a
      hint at its definition, which often uses linearlized
      mathematical notation similar to LaTeX (but without any
      backslashes).  Click on the name of a special function to go to
      its full definition in the online
      NIST <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/">Digital Library of
      Mathematical Functions</a> (DLMF), which the notation used in
      the templates generally follows. (This occasionally differs
      slightly from the notation used in the REDUCE Manual.)
    </p>
    <p>The function dialogue boxes provide a grid of function
      templates.  Click on the radio button to the left of the
      function you want to use.  All but the active template is
      disabled and greyed out.  The templates display the conventional
      notation used for the functions but with editable text fields
      holding the function arguments.  The default arguments are
      either <em>ws</em>, where this seems appropriate, or the
      conventional variable names, usually those used in the DLMF.
    </p>
    <p>All <em>Functions</em> dialogue boxes have a pair of radio
      buttons at the top labelled <em>Symbolic</em>
      and <em>Numeric</em> that allow you to switch between the two
      modes of evaluation; the default is <em>Symbolic</em>.
      The <em>Numeric</em> option causes the template output to
      turn <em>rounded</em> mode on before the main template result is
      output and off again afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>There are also some switches towards the bottom, depending on
      the <em>Symbolic/Numeric</em> option.  The switches consist of
      check boxes that initially show default settings (not those
      currently in effect in REDUCE).  Any switches that are changed
      from their defaults are set in the template output to reflect
      the change before the main template result is output and reset
      afterwards.  (Beware that this will override any changes from
      the default switch settings that were in effect before the
      template was used.)  All dialogues provide the
      switch <em>complex</em>, which in most cases is available only
      in <em>numeric</em> mode and turns on the use of complex
      arithmetic; it is off by default.  All dialogues also provide
      the switch <em>savesfs</em>, which turns on caching of numerical
      values of special functions; it is on by default.
    </p>
    <p>This menu is disabled unless REDUCE is running.
    The <em>Templates</em> menu provides the following items:</p>
    <h3>Exp, Log, Power, etc...</h3>
    <p>This provides the exponential function, various logarithms,
    power and roots (surds or radicals), factorial and binomial
    coefficients, and the <em>hypot</em>, <em>atan<sub>2</sub></em>
    and <em>atan<sub>2</sub>d</em> functions.  The latter
    automatically loads the TRIGD package.
    </p>
    <h3>Gamma & Beta Functions, etc...</h3>
    <p>This provides the Gamma, Beta, digamma, polygamma, normalized
    incomplete Gamma and Beta, and dilogarithm functions, Pochhammer's
    symbols, binomial coefficients and the Riemann zeta function.
    </p>
   <h3>Integral Functions...</h3>
    <p>This provides exponential, logarithmic, sine, cosine,
    hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine integral functions, the
    error function and complementary error function, and the Fresnel
    sine and cosine integral functions.
    </p>
    <h3>Airy & Bessel Functions, etc...</h3>
    <p>This provides Airy functions of the first (Ai) and second (Bi)
    kind and their derivatives (Ai' and Bi'), and the families of
    Bessel functions of the first (<em>J</em>) and second (<em>Y</em>)
    kind, modified Bessel functions of the first (<em>I</em>) and
    second (<em>K</em>) kind, and Hankel functions of the first and
    second kind.
    </p>
