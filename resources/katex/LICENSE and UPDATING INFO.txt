UPDATING INFO -- FJW

Unpack katex.zip into ..\Run-REDUCE\resources, keeping only the fonts directory,
katex.min.css and katex.min.js.

JavaFX 17 WebView cannot read .woff2 font files, so keep only the .woff
font files in the fonts directory. (I hope that WebView in a later version
of JavaFX will accept .woff2 font files!)

I created this file; it is not in katex.zip but I copied the license above
from https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX.
